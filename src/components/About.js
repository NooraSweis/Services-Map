            This website aims to help tourists and the people to find the location of the service that they are looking for. In our project, we will focus on the city of Tulkarm. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            It includes a map of the city that includes all the services and facilities. The purpose is to identify all the facilities and services of the city. Thus from one hand, we aim to help the user to easily reach his goal. On the other hand, help service providers to add their locations and their products, by including them on the city map. This will help them in making their services or products visible to users. Thus facilitating people's access to the required services through browsing, searching, and selecting the desired location as it is on the map.
